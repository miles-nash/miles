🏕 Tagline: Finding clarity in ambiguity — building at the intersection of hardware, systems, and spirit.

👋 Introduction
Hi, I'm Miles — an Engineer, tinkerer, and technical program manager passionate about shaping the future of physical technology and intelligent systems. From Colorado roots and outdoor adventures to managing Tesla vehicle programs and exploring AI at Microsoft, my journey is defined by curiosity, execution, and a drive to make ideas real.

My work spans hardware, systems, and product leadership — blending engineering execution with a designer's intuition and a strategist's mindset.

🧭 Philosophy & Design Ethos
"Form follows clarity."
This site is a minimalist digital studio — a thought archive, personal lab notebook, and philosophical sketchpad. Inspired by Gwern.net, MIT Media Lab, and Harvard GSD, it reflects an ongoing, living process. I believe in:

- Content over container
- Editorial depth over trendiness
- Minimal, not sterile — purposeful design
- Studio rhythm and notebook evolution
- Open-ended curiosity, not artificial urgency

I build not just for utility, but for meaning. My compass is curiosity. My map is iterative failure. My north star is clarity.
